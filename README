Dropbox XHTML generator

Usage:
	./gen.sh [txt|mp3]

This script should be placed in ~/Dropbox/somedir/gen.sh.
All the templates (*_[header|footer].txt) should be placed in the same dir.

Currently supported formats: *.txt, *.mp3

For text documents only direct links are generated.

For MP3s there is embedded Flash-player provided by http://flv-mp3.com/ru/mp3/ - it's free and easy!

TODO:

Support for *.jpg (with auto-generated previews in ../Public/jpg/thumbs/).

Support for videos (with embedded player by flv-mp3.com)

Support for common files, building just a file-index for the folder. This might be a separate option.
